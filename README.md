Liri-node-app

This app is trying to give life to several concepts we have learned lately.

-It was nice for us to start to learn about ES6 and try to sneak some of the new syntax in.
-Switch case
-npm modules and how to require them
-how to load npm modules into local files
-maybe my biggest hurdle was learning how to "PROPERLY" create a .gitignore file 
-.env was a new thing for me this time around
-continuing to work with API calls and how to do the dance to get the right information in the right form to display
-working into more clever or elegant ways to call a function to do "everything" (or as much as you can) and having the information to be called on as variables
